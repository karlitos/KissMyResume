# KissMyResume

_[HackMyResume](https://github.com/hacksalot/HackMyResume) but [Keep it simple, (stupid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)_. I really liked the original HackMyResume tool, but it lacked some important features, did not always provide the best results and I found the code base rather complicated. So I created my own version, strongly inspired by the HackMyResume project and the [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli), but tried to __keep it simple__ by relying on off-the-shelf tools and libraries.

The project is still WIP and in very early stage. It targets following shortcomings of the __HackMyResume__ [1] and __resume-cli__ [2] tools:
* missing support for asynchronous template rendering (1,2)
* PDF export relying on 3rd party tools (1)
* exported PDF looking differently than HTML printed as PDF (1)
* no support for local themes (2)

## Current status

To provide best support for the [broad variety of 3rd party themes](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=jsonresume-theme) the [official release (0.0.0)](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/releases/tag/0.0.0) of Json-resume schema is supported and used for validation.

Since the version 1.0.0 there is a Desktop App build with [electron](www.electronjs.org) and [electron-forge](https://www.electronforge.io/) which is currently still in very early __beta__ stage. So far it allows to create resumes with a web-form generated automatically from the json-resume-scheme, allows to open and validate resumes in JSON format, render them and export in the same formats as the CLI. The GUI utilizes the CLI, so all the original functionality was preserved.

The App allows to download the jsonresume-themes from NPM automatically and use them for rendering. I can not guarantee, that all 3rd party themes will work, around 30-40 were tested with satisfactory results, so far a bunch of them had to be blacklisted. In a case a theme shall not work, please open an issue on Github.

### Build
```bash
   USAGE

     cli.js build <source>

   ARGUMENTS

     <source>      The path to the source JSON resume file.      required

   OPTIONS

     -f, --format <format>              Set output format (HTML|PDF|YAML|DOCX|PNG|ALL)                                        optional      default: "all"                  
     -p, --paper-size <paper-size>      Set output size for PDF files (A4|Letter|Legal|Tabloid|Ledger|A0|A1|A2|A3|A5|A6)      optional      default: "A4"                   
     -o, --out <directory>              Set output directory                                                                  optional      default: "./out"                
     -n, --name <name>                  Set output file name                                                                  optional      default: "resume"               
     -t, --theme <theme>                Set the theme you wish to use                                                         optional      default: "jsonresume-theme-flat"
```
The default theme for the resume is the [flat-theme](https://github.com/erming/jsonresume-theme-flat) - same as resume-cli. You can use local themes or themes installed from NPM with the `-t, --theme` option flag. You can use the theme name `flat`, npm package name `jsonresume-theme-flat` or a local path `node_modules/jsonresume-theme-flat`.

The theme must expose a __render__ method returning the the HTML markup in its entry-point file. The theme can expose a __renderAsync__ method returning a Promise resolving to HTML Markup. With this, the theme will be still compatible with the HackMyResume and resume-cli tools.

Export to Docx is very basic and supports images as long they are encoded in Base64 and included within the HTML markup `<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGOD ...` 

My [mocha-responsive](https://github.com/karlitos/jsonresume-theme-mocha-responsive) theme supports __async rendering__ and inline __Base64 encoded__ profile pictures, give it a shot!
